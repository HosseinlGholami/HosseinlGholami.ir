  <h2>Smart Scale V1: Industrial Weighing Meets Embedded Intelligence</h2>
  <p>
    Weighing may seem simple, but in logistics, accuracy, automation, and uptime are non-negotiable. At Digikala, our Robotics team designed the Smart Scale to optimize weight measurement in fast-paced environments. It's more than just a weighing device ‚Äî it‚Äôs a connected, precise, and easy-to-use system that reduces human error, integrates with our backend, and boosts operational efficiency.
  </p>

  <h3>Why We Built It</h3>
  <p>
    Traditional scales in industrial setups are often prone to errors, require manual intervention, and don‚Äôt integrate easily with WMS platforms. Our goal was to eliminate drift, downtime, and disconnected processes ‚Äî and create a durable smart device that communicates weight data in real time, works with minimal buttons, and is intuitive even for new operators.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>‚úî High-precision load cell with &lt;11.5g error on 50kg capacity</li>
    <li>‚úî Auto-sends weight to server via MQTT over Wi-Fi </li>
    <li>‚úî Works >48h on rechargeable battery; standard 220V power</li>
    <li>‚úî OTA firmware updates supported</li>
    <li>‚úî Physical indicators and intuitive controls reduce training needs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>
    Operators place a package on the weighing platform. A <strong>Zemic L6E-C3</strong> load cell detects the applied force and sends a small analog voltage signal to the <strong>HX711</strong> module. The HX711 amplifies and digitizes the signal and passes it to the <strong>ESP32</strong> microcontroller. The ESP32 processes the weight value, transmits it to the backend via <strong>MQTT</strong>, and indicates device status using integrated LEDs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The device is designed with simplicity in mind ‚Äî only two buttons control it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Button:</strong> A two-position toggle switch. Pressing inward turns the device on, pulling outward turns it off.</li>
    <li><strong>Reset Button:</strong> Instantly zeroes the scale. A flashing LED confirms each reset action.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    A <strong>Django-based server</strong> manages the system‚Äôs backend logic. It exposes RESTful APIs that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow the WMS (Warehouse Management System) to request live weight readings.</li>
    <li>Send <strong>MQTT commands</strong> to the ESP32 to fetch weight, perform resets, or change configuration values.</li>
    <li>Enable real-time updates to device parameters such as battery thresholds or calibration coefficients ‚Äî all from a web UI.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Additionally, the Smart Scale supports <strong>OTA (Over-the-Air)</strong> firmware updates, allowing engineers to push new features or bug fixes without physical access to the device.

    <h2>Smart Scale System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The Smart Scale is a modular, connected device designed for precise weight measurement and remote integration in warehouse environments. Its architecture is divided into mechanical, electronic, embedded software, and server layers.
    </p>

      The 370√ó370mm MDF platform is mounted on a precision load cell and housed in a vibration-dampened aluminum chassis. Adjustable feet ensure stability and alignment, critical for accurate readings in industrial environments.

    <p>
      The system receives power from a 220V AC source, which is stepped down and regulated through TPS and AMS1117 modules. An ESP32 microcontroller coordinates weight sensing via the HX711, manages user input (on/off/reset), and drives status LEDs. A CH340 module is used for programming, and power redundancy is supported via battery regulation.

        <strong>Figure:</strong> Firmware layer interaction and component responsibilities.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The embedded firmware is modularized to handle power management, sensor acquisition, configuration persistence, and connectivity. Each component is designed to operate independently while communicating through shared parameters or message queues.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Uplink</strong>: Publishes MQTT messages to the server and handles parameter updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>: Connects to the local network using DHCP and EAP (PEAP) authentication.</li>
      <li><strong>OTA</strong>: Fetches firmware updates from the server and applies them upon command via Uplink.</li>
      <li><strong>Param</strong>: Manages runtime configuration, calibration values, and storage in RAM or NVRAM.</li>
      <li><strong>Database</strong>: Provides local persistence of recent parametersusing NVRAM.</li>
      <li><strong>HX711</strong>: Interfaces with the load cell to read and convert analog measurements into digital values.</li>
      <li><strong>Battery Manager</strong>: Monitors battery voltage and charging status to ensure reliable operation.</li>
      <li><strong>LED Manager</strong>: Controls status indicators for power, battery, and buttons.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>üñ• Server Software Design</h3>

    </div>
    
    <p>
      The backend architecture orchestrates all communication between the user interface, database, and IoT devices. It is containerized using Docker and includes the following components:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nginx</strong>: Acts as a reverse proxy for routing HTTP(S) traffic and serves the static files of the React application.</li>
      <li><strong>Django</strong>: Hosts the RESTful API for controlling devices and accessing historical data. Integrated with Celery to run background tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>MySQL</strong>: Stores weight measurements, configuration parameters, and calibration history.</li>
      <li><strong>RabbitMQ + Celery</strong>: Implements a distributed task queue to handle asynchronous jobs such as OTA updates, parameter synchronization, and scheduled tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>React App</strong>: A responsive, browser-based interface for administrators and operators to interact with devices and data.</li>
      <li><strong>RabbitMQ (MQTT)</strong>: Facilitates real-time communication between the Django backend and ESP32 devices using MQTT protocol.</li>
    </ul>
