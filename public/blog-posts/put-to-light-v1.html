  <h2>Put-to-Light-v1: Simplifying the Most Repetitive Task in the Warehouse</h2>
  <p>
    In high-volume fulfillment environments like Digikala, consistency and speed are essential — 
    especially for the repetitive but critical task of placing items into the correct pigeonboxes. 
    To reduce human error and cognitive load, our Automation & Robotics team developed a custom 
    Put-to-Light (P2L) system designed to guide warehouse operators with visual cues and simplified confirmation steps.
  </p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>
    In each pigeon (a sorting zone), 180 pigeonboxes receive items from totes arriving via conveyor. 
    Operators use handheld scanners to scan each item and receive the corresponding pigeonbox number. 
    In version 1 of our P2L system, instead of manually locating and scanning the pigeonbox label, 
    operators can follow a visual light signal on the destination box and confirm the action by 
    pressing a color-coded button. For fallback or compatibility, the system also supports the 
    traditional method — scanning the pigeonbox barcode to complete the sorting step.
  </p>


  <h3>System Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    The Put-to-Light v1 system was engineered with modularity, expandability, and reliability at its core. It is composed of distributed embedded devices, centralized control logic, and flexible communication protocols. The architecture supports scale-up across pigeon zones and ensures robust operation even in noisy industrial environments.

    <p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Physical layout of devices in one pigeon — including hubs, switches, and client devices.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Each <strong>pigeon</strong> (our modular sorting unit) is equipped with up to <strong>six hubs</strong>, 
    providing a scalable foundation for high-volume sortation. 
    Every hub is connected to <strong>six switches</strong>, and each switch supports 
    up to <strong>30 P2L client devices</strong>. 
    This configuration results in a standard deployment of <strong>180 pigeonboxes per pigeon</strong>, 
    with the flexibility to expand as operational demands grow.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Communication throughout the system is designed for both stability and security. 
    The <strong>server communicates with the hubs</strong> using the <strong>MQTT protocol</strong> 
    (managed by <strong>RabbitMQ</strong>). 
    From the hub to the client devices, communication is handled over the <strong>CAN Bus protocol</strong>, 
    which offers reliable, low-latency performance even in industrial environments. 
    In parallel, the server integrates with <strong>Digikala’s core system, Supernova</strong>, 
    using a suite of <strong>RESTful HTTPS APIs</strong> to manage authentication, barcode inquiries, 
    and task acknowledgments.
  </p>

  <h3>Hardware Components</h3>

  <h3>1 – P2L Nodes</h3>
  <p>
    Each pigeonbox is equipped with a compact, custom-designed <strong>P2L node</strong> that acts as the primary user interface for the sorting operator. 
    These nodes are built for simplicity, clarity, and reliability under continuous warehouse operation.
  </p>
  
  <ul style="font-size: 0.8em;">
    <li><strong>5 Push-Button LEDs:</strong> Color-coded buttons allow up to five operators to work simultaneously on a single pigeon.</li>
    <li><strong>AVR Microcontroller:</strong> The node is controlled by an <code>ATMega16</code> chip, chosen for its cost-efficiency and sufficient IO capability.</li>
    <li><strong>Display:</strong> A 7-segment display provides basic system information such as pigeonbox ID or error codes.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> CAN Bus protocol ensures stable and real-time message transmission in electrically noisy environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Casing:</strong> The enclosure is built from matte black ST37 sheet metal, designed with a curved form for durability and ergonomic usability.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>
  
  <h3>2 – P2L Hubs</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>P2L hub</strong> acts as the bridge between the cloud server and the client devices inside each pigeon. 
    It handles protocol translation, OTA updates, and distributes commands received over the network to the correct downstream nodes.
  </p>
  
  <ul style="font-size: 0.8em;">
    <li><strong>ESP32 Microcontroller:</strong> The hub is powered by an ESP32 module, chosen for its dual-core architecture, built-in Wi-Fi, TLS 1.2 support, and flexible peripheral support.</li>
    <li><strong>CAN Transceiver:</strong> A <code>MCP2551</code> chip connects the ESP32 to the CAN Bus, enabling communication with switches and P2L clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Regulation:</strong> A 5V input is stepped down to 3.3V using an <code>AMS1117</code> regulator for ESP32 logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Enclosure:</strong> The hub is housed in a 3D-printed PLA body with insert nuts for easy mounting and servicing.</li>
    <li><strong>OTA Support:</strong> Firmware updates can be applied both to the ESP32 and to the client devices over CAN Bus using a custom bootloader.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>System Architecture Layers</h4>
  <p>The system is built in modular layers to isolate responsibilities and improve maintainability:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cloud Server:</strong> Developed in Django (Python), it connects with Digikala’s Supernova platform via RESTful APIs to manage login, barcode lookup, and task acknowledgment.</li>
    <li><strong>MQTT Messaging Layer:</strong> Powered by RabbitMQ, this layer handles real-time message exchange between server and ESP32-based hubs.</li>
    <li><strong>Hub (ESP32):</strong> Interprets server commands and communicates with client devices via CAN Bus.</li>
    <li><strong>Client Devices (AVR Nodes):</strong> Light up the relevant pigeonbox and wait for button press acknowledgment from the operator.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Monitoring Dashboard (Kibana)</h3>
  
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="/images/p2l-v1/6.png" alt="Put-to-Light Kibana Monitoring Dashboard" style="width: 90%; max-width: 700px;" class="mx-auto">

      <strong>Figure 5:</strong> Kibana dashboard for system performance, latency, and usage monitoring.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    To ensure reliability at scale, we use the <strong>ELK stack</strong> (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) 
    for comprehensive observability. Operators and engineers can track system behavior in real time and 
    respond proactively.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Monitoring Capabilities</h4>
  <ul style="font-size: 0.95em;">
    <li><strong>Sorted Items:</strong> Track how many items were sorted and acknowledged.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Button vs. scan activity, request latency, and throughput.</li>
    <li><strong>Error Detection:</strong> Visualize API timeouts and response code distributions.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Analytics:</strong> Monitor OS/browser versions, IP distribution, and device usage trends.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    These insights empower the operations team to ensure system health, respond to issues faster, and 
    continuously optimize the overall workflow.
