<h3>System Overview</h3>
<p>
  This project turns raw motion signals from vehicle‑mounted sensors into actionable safety insights.
  Using accelerometer and gyroscope data, the edge device segments streams into sliding windows and detects harsh
  events such as abrupt braking, aggressive acceleration, sharp turns, and lane changes. Detected events and
  metadata are published to the cloud in real time for storage, analytics, and trip grading.
</p>

<h3>System Architecture</h3>
<p>
  The pipeline has three layers: on‑vehicle sensing and lightweight detection, a cloud ingestion/processing tier,
  and a scoring &amp; dashboard layer. Vehicles publish over MQTT; RabbitMQ handles message brokering (MQTT plugin)
  and Redis provides fast in‑memory buffering. Long‑term data lands in PostgreSQL and the system is packaged in
  Docker for reproducible deployment and horizontal scaling.

<h3>Hardware Components</h3>
<h4>1 – In‑Vehicle IoT Device</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Microcontroller / Phone: ESP32 or smartphone SoC</li>
  <li>Sensors: 3‑axis accelerometer &amp; 3‑axis gyroscope</li>
  <li>Communication: MQTT over Wi‑Fi/BLE or cellular</li>
</ul>

<h4>2 – Data Uplink</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Protocol: MQTT topics per vehicle/trip</li>
  <li>Message Broker: RabbitMQ (MQTT plugin)</li>
  <li>Temporary Storage: Redis streams/cache</li>
</ul>

<h3>Software Components</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Sliding‑window analysis with FastDTW (template matching) + pruned decision tree (ID3) for event classification</li>
  <li><strong>Backend Workers:</strong> Python services for ingestion, labeling, aggregation, and scoring</li>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL for durable, queryable history</li>
  <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Docker &amp; Docker Compose for simple deployment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Frontend Application</h3>
<p>
  A web dashboard for fleet managers and insurers shows live event counts, trip timelines, and driver scorecards.
  Operators can drill down into a trip to review the sequence and severity of detected events.

<h3>System Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Real‑time MQTT throughput and broker queue depth</li>
  <li>End‑to‑end latency (edge window → labeled event → persisted record)</li>
  <li>Worker health, error rates, and device online status</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Macro F1 on test set: <strong>≈90%</strong> with a 186‑sample window and pruned decision tree (depth ≈12)</li>
  <li>On‑device event detection: real‑time friendly via sliding windows + FastDTW comparison</li>
  <li>Cloud ingestion stability: sustained processing under bursty uploads with Redis buffering</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  By combining efficient classical signal‑processing (FastDTW) with a lightweight decision tree and a lean,
  containerized backend, the system delivers accurate, real‑time driver behavior profiling on modest hardware.
  Next steps include exploring temporal deep networks for richer behaviors, broader calibration across vehicles/mounts,
  and extending scoring to insurance pricing and coaching feedback loops.
