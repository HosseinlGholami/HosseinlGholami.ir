<h3>System Overview</h3>
<p>
  The thesis addressed the growing need for accurate driver behavior profiling using only motion data collected 
  from smartphones and low-cost embedded sensors. Traditional insurance models rely on demographic factors 
  such as age and location, but do not directly reflect how a person actually drives. By detecting harsh 
  events such as braking, accelerating, and turning, the system aimed to quantify driving style objectively 
  and propose a framework for usage-based insurance (UBI).
</p>
<p>
  The research was designed as a <strong>software and dataset-driven study</strong>. No custom hardware was built; 
  instead, the focus was on analyzing sensor datasets, implementing efficient algorithms, and simulating 
  the full cloud pipeline that such a system would use in practice.
</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>
  The experiments were based on the dataset published by 
  <strong>J. Ferreira, Jr., et al. (2017), “Driver behavior profiling: An investigation with different smartphone sensors and machine learning,” PLoS ONE, 12(4)</strong>. 
  This dataset contains smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope recordings of multiple trips, 
  annotated with normal and harsh driving events. It provides a challenging real-world benchmark: 
  sensor signals are noisy, time-warped (events occur with different durations), and influenced by road 
  conditions and driver idiosyncrasies.
</p>
<p>
  Preprocessing involved normalizing the sensor readings, segmenting them into 
  <strong>sliding windows</strong>, and labeling each segment according to the ground truth. 
  Three window sizes (126, 186, and 226 samples) were systematically compared. 
  Results showed that 186-sample windows offered the best trade-off: 
  smaller windows produced fragmented detections, while larger windows diluted event boundaries 
  and increased computational cost.
</p>

<h3>Event Detection with DTW</h3>
<p>
  A key innovation was the use of <strong>Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)</strong> and its fast approximation, FastDTW. 
  Unlike simple Euclidean distance, DTW can align two sequences that differ in length or speed. 
  For example, two drivers may brake harshly, but one event lasts 0.8 seconds and the other 1.2 seconds. 
  DTW computes an optimal alignment path between these time series, making it robust to such distortions. 
</p>
<p>
  For each window, DTW distances to reference event templates were calculated. 
  These similarity measures served as the main features for classification. 
  This approach allowed the system to capture the “shape” of events, not just raw thresholds on acceleration.
</p>

<h3>Classification with Decision Trees</h3>
<p>
  The next step was classification. A pruned <strong>ID3 decision tree</strong> was trained on the DTW-derived features. 
  Several tree depths were explored. Shallow trees underfit, while overly deep trees risked memorizing 
  noise in the dataset. A depth of around 12 strikes proved to be the sweet spot, achieving a 
  <strong>macro F1-score of ~90%</strong> on the test set, while training F1 reached ~94%. 
  Importantly, decision trees provide interpretable rules (“if DTW distance to braking template &lt; threshold → classify as harsh brake”), 
  making them easier to validate in a safety-critical context than black-box models.
</p>

<h3>Cloud Architecture (Simulation)</h3>
<p>
  While the research framed the system as a cloud-based telematics platform, 
  the <strong>entire cloud architecture was simulated</strong>. 
  All feature extraction, DTW comparisons, and decision tree predictions were performed at the edge 
  (i.e., in the same environment as the dataset). 
  Events were then “sent” to a simulated backend to test scalability and data handling.
</p>
<p>
  The simulated backend consisted of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RabbitMQ with MQTT plugin</strong> — representing the message broker that ingests event packets.</li>
  <li><strong>Redis</strong> — used as a fast in-memory buffer for stream processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker containers</strong> — packaging all components to simulate deployment, scaling, and monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although no live devices were connected, this simulation validated the feasibility of a distributed architecture 
  and demonstrated how edge event detection could integrate seamlessly with a scalable cloud backend.
</p>

<h3>Trip Grading and Insurance Use Case</h3>
<p>
  A major contribution of the thesis was the <strong>trip grading model</strong>. 
  Instead of treating events in isolation, the system aggregated detected events over each trip. 
  Statistical features such as the number of harsh braking events per kilometer, 
  or the ratio of aggressive turns to total turns, were computed. 
  Each trip was then assigned a safety grade.
</p>
<p>
  This framework enables applications in <strong>usage-based insurance (UBI)</strong>. 
  Safer drivers, with fewer harsh events, would receive lower premiums. 
  Conversely, drivers with riskier patterns would be incentivized to improve. 
  Beyond insurance, such trip grading could also support fleet operators, 
  who wish to coach drivers and reduce accidents.
</p>

<h3>Performance Analysis</h3>
<p>
  Extensive experiments were performed to evaluate window size, DTW runtime, and decision tree depth. 
  Key findings include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Window size:</strong> 186 samples yielded the best macro F1 ≈ 90%.</li>
  <li><strong>DTW runtime:</strong> With FastDTW, detection latency remained &lt; 250 ms per event, suitable for real-time use.</li>
  <li><strong>Tree depth:</strong> Best balance at depth ~12, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting.</li>
  <li><strong>Event-level performance:</strong> Harsh braking and sharp turns were classified with the highest precision/recall, 
      while subtle acceleration patterns were more error-prone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  This thesis demonstrated that driver behavior profiling can be achieved effectively with only smartphone motion data 
  and carefully chosen algorithms. By combining DTW for temporal alignment with decision trees for classification, 
  the system delivered robust, interpretable, and efficient results. 
</p>
<p>
  Although the cloud architecture was simulated, the research provided a proof-of-concept for how 
  edge-based event detection can integrate with scalable backend systems. 
  The proposed trip grading model highlights the value of such systems for insurers, 
  fleet managers, and road safety initiatives. 
  Future work should explore larger and more diverse datasets, integration of GPS and contextual data, 
  and the use of deep learning for complex event recognition.
