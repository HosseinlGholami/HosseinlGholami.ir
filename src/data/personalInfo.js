  description: 'Embedded & IoT Engineer creating reliable systems that connect hardware, the cloud, and end-users.',

  about: {
    journey: `Over the past few years, I’ve worked across embedded development, 
    backend services, and IoT applications. My journey began with electronics 
    and firmware for IoT and robotics devices, and gradually expanded into 
    backend systems using Django/FastAPI and frontend development with React. 
    Along the way, I’ve contributed to projects such as dimension detection systems, 
    wheel sorters, smart scales, and put-to-light solutions for e-commerce 
    fulfillment centers. Each project has been a chance to solve real-world 
    challenges and grow both technically and personally.`,

    philosophy: `I aim to design systems that are practical, reliable, and easy to use. 
    My approach is to connect low-level embedded engineering with scalable cloud software 
    to create complete IoT solutions. I’m especially interested in automation, 
    where even small improvements in hardware–software integration 
    can make a meaningful difference in operations.`,
