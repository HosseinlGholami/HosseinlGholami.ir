  description: 'Embedded systems engineer and full-stack developer with expertise in automation, IoT, and modern web technologies. Passionate about building scalable systems that bridge hardware and software.',
  about: {
    journey: `With over 4 years of experience, I have worked across embedded development, 
    backend services, and full-stack applications. My journey began in electronics 
    and firmware development for IoT and robotics devices, and later expanded into backend 
    systems with Django/FastAPI and frontend development with React. I have designed 
    and delivered industrial automation devices such as dimension detection, wheel sorters, smart 
    scales, and put-to-light systems for large-scale e-commerce fulfillment centers.`,
    philosophy: `I believe in designing systems that are not only functional but also 
    reliable and user-friendly. My focus is on blending low-level 
    embedded engineering with cloud-native software to deliver end-to-end solutions. 
    I am particularly interested in IoT applications and solutions, where hardware and 
    software integration can create real-world impact at scale.`,
