  description: 'Embedded systems & IoT engineer with an interest in building connected devices and automation solutions. From warehouse robotics to consumer IoT products, I try to design systems that connect hardware with the cloud in a simple and reliable way. While embedded development is my main focus, I also work with backend APIs and frontend apps when needed, to make sure projects come together end-to-end.',

  about: {
    journey: `Over the past few years, I’ve had the chance to work across embedded development, 
    backend services, and IoT applications. My journey started with electronics and firmware 
    development for IoT and robotics devices, and gradually expanded into backend systems 
    using Django/FastAPI and frontend development with React. Along the way, I’ve been part of 
    projects like dimension detection systems, wheel sorters, smart scales, and put-to-light 
    solutions that support e-commerce fulfillment centers. Each project has been a learning 
    opportunity that helped me grow both technically and personally.`,
    philosophy: `I try to design systems that are practical, reliable, and easy to use. 
    My approach is to connect low-level embedded engineering with cloud software to build 
    complete IoT solutions. I’m particularly interested in IoT applications and automation, 
    where even small improvements in hardware–software integration can make a meaningful 
    difference in real-world operations.`,
